Start with cloning the repo
Then run the following command:  npm install
then run: npm start
Run the backendserver before the frontend and then type the command: npm start 
You will get a prompt that the port 3000 is already running and it will ask to run on the different port, enter Y and it should run the front end on a different port because port 3000 will be used by the backend server.
